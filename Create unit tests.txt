Here is c# class "StudentConverte":

    public class StudentConverte
    {
        public List<Student> ConvertStudents(List<Student> students)
        {
            return students.Select(student =>
            {
                var result = new Student
                {
                    Name = student.Name,
                    Age = student.Age,
                    Grade = student.Grade
                };

                if (student.Grade > 90)
                {
                    if (student.Age < 21)
                    {
                        result.Exceptional = true;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        result.HonorRoll = true;
                    }
                }
                else if (student.Grade > 70)
                {
                    result.Passed = true;
                }
                else
                {
                    result.Passed = false;
                }

                return result;

            }).ToList();
        }
    }
	
where "Student" is class:

    public class Student
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }

        public int Age { get; set; }

        public int Grade { get; set; }

        public bool Exceptional { get; set; }

        public bool HonorRoll { get; set; }

        public bool Passed { get; set; }
    }
	
Please write unit tests for class "StudentConverte"
by using xUnit library and by using next test cases:

Positive Test Cases: 

Case 1: High Achiever 
Given an array with a student object of age 21 or above and grade above 90, the function should return an object with the additional field HonorRoll = true. 

Case 2: Exceptional Young High Achiever 
Given an array with a student object of age less than 21 and grade above 90, the function should return an object with the additional field Exceptional = true. 

Case 3: Passed Student 
Given an array with a student object of grade between 71 and 90 (inclusive), the function should return an object with the additional field Passed = true. 

Case 4: Failed Student 
Given an array with a student object of grade 70 or less, the function should return an object with the additional field Passed = false. 

Negative Test Cases: 

Case 1: Empty Array 
Given an empty array, the function should return an empty array. 

Case 2: Not an Array  
Given a null as an input the function should throw an error. 

?

Please rewrite your unit test class "StudentConverteTests" that you just wrote above by using "SetUp" method for xUnit library 
and initialize the object "StudentConverte" in this "SetUp" method?
